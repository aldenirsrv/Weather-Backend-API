**Tech Assessment #2 — Backend Engineers**

This is a Python FastAPI backend weather application. It allows users to enter a location and date range, validates the input, retrieves real weather data from an external API, stores the request and response in a SQLite database, supports CRUD operations, and exports stored data to JSON or CSV.

## Tech Stack

- SQLite
- SQLAlchemy
- Pydantic
- Open-Meteo API
- Uvicorn

## Features

- Search weather by city/location
- Validate location using Open-Meteo Geocoding API
- Validate date range

## Additional API / Location Integration

In addition to retrieving weather data, the backend also enriches each weather request with location context:

- A Google Maps URL generated from the resolved latitude and longitude
- A YouTube search URL for travel/weather-related videos about the selected location

This helps users not only check the weather, but also understand the location they are searching for.
